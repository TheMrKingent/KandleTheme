# Kandle Theme for R Studio

The theme I use for R Studio, carefully handcrafted to make the world's ugliest IDE look like [VS Code](https://github.com/tal7aouy/theme)! Support for rainbow parentheses, parenthesis pair highlight and function call highlight.

I reccomend using it in combination with [Darkstudio](https://github.com/rileytwo/darkstudio).
